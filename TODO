HAMMER
------
✓ Step 1 is "create a dimension"
✓ Step 2 is "give the client an extra world for that dimension"
  Step 3 is "create pseudoplayer, have packets sent to the pseudoplayer be sent to the real players, and render part of the dimension"
✓     -    have packets go to all players near the DSE; single PacketProxyingPlayer per DSE
✓     -    send chunks to players
      -    Actually update the terrain when it changes
      -    Actually consistently render the terrain when spawned
      -    Actually releasing the display list when leaving the dimension
✓ Step 4 is to make the DSE interact with the real world
✓     -    DSE persistence
✓     -    external entity collisions, using custom AABBs
  Step 5 is to get player interactions working
✓     -    placing blocks
✓     -    activating blocks
      -    GUIs
      -    breaking blocks
              - We'll just do everything ourselves; no trying to go through vanilla code

              - Server-side: Client will send packets similar to Packet14BlockDig; we'll bamboozle ItemInWorldManager (Or replace it with our own, possibly temporarily. This might be better, as it'd be very simple to replace it when we're done.)
              - Client-side: Can we set fields in places to make it do the digging animation?
              - Do that IWorldAccess partial block breaking rendering on the client; make sure the player packet proxy gets the packets
X Step 6 is to get rotations working (Maybe later)
X     -    Get collisions working when rotated
  Step 7 is rockets & shit.
      -    Refactor DSE & its rendering for Oracles
✓     -    Proper command system
  Step 8 is watch mod interaction burst into flames.
      -    Put in a whitelist for Blocks, Entities, and TileEntities. (Probably a Object.getClass() mapping)
  Step 9 is "drop into the pending mods folder; run away giggling."

The hard rendering bit:
  On server:
    the player is made frozen/immortal somehow
    a puppet player is put in hammerspace
    packets go through frozen player normally
    puppet player wraps the packets
  On client:
    we leave our real player behind for the puppet player...
    so we change Minecraft.thePlayer to... the puppet player entity that the server's created

So, rewriting it. When the player gets embedded onto a DSE:
  Create the puppet player, spawn it into hammerspace
  Change the EntityPlayer that the socket is connected to to the puppet.
  Make the real EntityPlayer immortal/ghostly somehow. In particular, skeles need to ignore it. But it still needs to receive all other packets.
  It also needs to stay near the DSE when it moves
  PacketProxyPlayer needs to (or should) stop sending packets to the puppet-mastering player
  puppet player needs to wrap its packets
  Tell the player that they're now controlling the puppet

REARCHITECTING
--------------
Kill Wrath (This will make the mod so much simpler...):
  - Wrath lamp will require a ton of nebulae to craft
  - Dark iron obtained in ore form from asteroids (or if that takes too long, from inverium-ing iron blocks)
  - Actual wrath fire will be gone. So:
      - No more wrath forges
      - No more lighting things on fire
      - No more terrible particle effects
  - This will remove a use for diamond shards.


KILL
----
BOH -- Nah, it could be done better I think.
WRATH (But this adds rocketry. Ha. Definitely makes the mod smaller.)

SERVOS
------
regarding actuators:
  We'll keep a "generic use actuator instruction", but we'll also add instructions for each actuator. Possibly multiple ones per actuator.
  All the socket-tools we'll have:
    ✓ Lacerator
    ✓ Robot Arm
    ✓ Item Vacuum
    Chicken Baster
    Launcher (dispenser)
    Rotor (fzds)
    Grasper (gravity gun; fzds for just one block? Eh....)
    Ball Lightning Gun

Lower barriers to entry for servos:
    (Suuuugar crystalllss.... hard rock candy....)
  Eliminate dependencies on ore processing:
    alternative aqua regia recipe (substitute blaze powder for nether powder? or maybe magma cream?)
      Maybe this shouldn't make aqua regia; but instead an acid that's compatible.
  Maybe we should see about flattening our mod in other areas as well.
  Make dark iron an ore found at bedrock level
  Have a stack that's a "reaction" stack. So when the 'status' stack gets updated (this would be typical of a socket command), this stack could be triggered.

PRESSURE GENERATOR
------------------
mixer? We'd need a buffer. Yeah, we can go ahead with it.
FluidPump should do a simple spouting if on a servo

IMMEDIATE (for next public release)
---------
test:
    infinite loops
    writing instructions
[prooobably fixed. Yep. Definitely.] (It does now?) servos not syncing stacks to players holding LMPs like they should...
more creative tabs?


FZDOCS
------
Add stuff to document to this list!
well, what are the new instructions?
    set stack
    color
    item shifter control


SOON
----
servos:
  2 consecutive turns doesn't show the 2nd turn nicely -- No, that's not the behavior. -- Yes it is?
  refactor tool
    click once, then click a direction to move instructions... or something. Hmm.
    Maybe click to make a path? Too complicated.
    If you've got like forking and branches or stuff, you'll have to start at the end and work back.
  <digitalseraphim> is there a way to clear out error messages from the black stack yet?
pocket crafting table, clicking 1-item-at-a-time for the craft output, seems laggy. Are we over-syncing?
light shining through our blocks; barrels. I don't think we can actually fix this?
split up FactorizationClientProxy
Add pressure generator:
    - is an inventoryless mixer. Might also blow around chest contents? :D
    - It doesn't need an inventory behind it. But if there *is* an inventory behind it, it will move items into/outof that inventory.
    - two instructions: suck/blow and high/medium/low
    - change socket tool placement. First click w/ a motor; then click w/ the original socket thingie.
    Tell me more about using the fan as a mixer.
        Uses the inventory in front of it as the base inventory for the mixer; then it spits mixed stuff out the back.
        How does it deal with its configuration options?
            Suck/blow changes nothing, it will still output to the back. OR it only works in suck mode. (Incidentally, suck mode will probably be the default mode?)
            The speed setting will make it work faster.
    - It also works on fluids.
        If there is a liquid 'source' (either a TE providing a liquid, or a source block that we can handle) avail, then we push it in the appropriate direction. 
        pushes about 7*speed blocks away, and 3*speed blocks up.
        What about the filling algorithm? A pain, eh? Just something kinda randomish maybe?
    - Oh, also, it can get power from steam. (Well, any hot gas.)
An upgraded bonemeal. Acts as bonemeal, & schedules a block tick even if the bonemeal'd thing isn't bonemealable. 2 bonemeal + 4 nether wart -> 2 Nether Bone Meal. "It's Super-Effective!"
Check for calls we make to Tessellator.setBrightness. We may be able to replace them with a BlockRenderHelper helper function.

BEFORE 0.9
----------
Complete the in-game documentation:
    - The '?' key should bring up help for an item, if you've got the docbook in your inventory. Hopefully it'd work with the NEI sidebar as well.
    - Ability to include ItemStacks in the text. They'll need to support hyperlinks.
    - Possibly pictures? I might not need pictures tho.
    - Support for WWW links.
    - Demonstrations, with interactive diagrams; sort of reminiscent of the MC wiki stuff for redstone contraptions. They should render a world, and you can click and drag to rotate the view. If you're in creative mode, you should be able to press a button, labelled "import" possibly, to place it down.
    

WITH 0.9.0
----------
Remove junk we don't want. Routers, old barrels, lacerator
Back to FZDS


LESS SOON
---------
Check if dark iron retrogen works?
compression crafter; items that don't get used up (liiike LMP's) stay in the world?
    and also put in a temp recipe that uses wires; test that the CompACT doesn't destroy them
    crafting recipes that use the battery block?

AFTER 1.7 PORT
--------------
open sourcing the mod; get stuff ready for that. What needs to happen? Probably after porting to 1.7
  FZ has been packagized; now turn the packages into sub-modules.
  ack for TODO/XXX/FIXME
  start a dev blog; maybe at this time?
Thaumcraft Compat:
  thaumcraft wood barrels?
  SoundLogic thaumcraft aspects
  Remember to wrap mod compat module calls in try/catch!
Do we remove aluminum ore processing? It feels unnecessary to me.
Exchange Bag of Holding for just... free inventory space.
make leyden jars narrower. The purpose of this is to improve their proportions.
forge public/AT bullshit


UNTRIAGED
---------
can we move the position the servo renders at back? So that it can look like it's turning at a better place...
show what instruction is being hilighted in big?
/f entityrendertoggle; forgetTEs; forgetEnts
do maths on energy conversion:
  food to steam; we might even be able to do the heater thing? I suppose we COULD just blacklist boilers for furnace heaters...
  steam to charge to furnace-ing
  heaters: adding fuel should be cheap; progress not so much. Make 1 heater give 1 fuel instead of 2
  (And we still need cooking food to be worthwhile!)
LMP store instructions... Like a bag or a backpack
  - maybe let you merge instructions together? But then middle clicking.
Test BoH key with NEI installed & with sneak key set to a mouse button.
Church Organ
instructions mess up servo rail tessellator shading?
add an LMP instruction (recipe may be difficult!). Clicks the instruction with an LMP.
FZ notify item kept? [might be fixed? Weirdness.]
wires get messed up?


NEVER/POSTPONED
---------------
fix shading of faces of blocks that are in barrels; research if such a fix is possible
lightning should power our stuff; even if you can't make lightning rods... -- would require watching *every* entity that gets spawned
biome ID conflict detection


LESS TOP LIST
-------------
FML has code to disable mods now; can use it for FZDS...
"Puff Blocks": 9 feathers; it's the building block helper thingie
Notify is using FZ net code
clean up texture error messages (unused textures)
config files for disabling barrel types
test parasieves + comparators + recursion depth. Somehow.
localize ALL THE THINGS
I wonder if the bug hopper has any interesting crashlogs!
  - Oh yay the bug hopper is no longer running!
localize barrel types (There's a ton of other things what need to be localized, y'know...)
leyden jars & batteries should overcharge slightly so that they can drop exactly 100%-charged stuff
hopping barrels could be optimized if they're moving something above them to below them!
★★★Talk to RLP about monetization plan★★★
underground silver temples/vaults. With moon lamps? :D
onInventoryUpdate all the TEs
can't glaze a sculpture cloned from an already glazed sculpture
change raw glaze colors to their real colors
either bats are spawning in the hammer dimension, or we're getting entity updates that we shouldn't be
having more boilers/mirrors seems to give you more steam somehow
notification system upgrade:
  extra controls for clearing up other notifications: get rid of nearby messages (barrels), start fading the message away as soon as it shows up (energy measurements), remove any messages that have the same typename as this one, leave the message up for # seconds
  being able to group messages together might be nice; so you could do "clear tutorialMessages".
Modularize FZ/astro so that astro has no deps & can be removed for public release
Config option for ore processing output
IMC for adding new Ores to the Ore Processing chain?
configuration method for adding ores?
Placing/breaking wrath lamp in hammerspace seems to cause the client to crap its pants
Don't keep non-weak references to worlds ("MapMaker.weakKeys().buildMap()") except in Entity/TileEntity
register ore blocks
compression crafter notification showing a bunch of ==='s? o_O
To kill NEI's shift-? cheat: clear out RecipeInfo.overlayMap... or something.  Hmm....
  Might want to just remove instances whose class = DefaultOverlayHandler or BrewingOverlayHandler.
http://jezek2.advel.cz/tmp/jstackalloc/javadoc/
richardG suggests doing world.blockExists to prevent orphaning chunks:
  new socket stufff....
  hopping barrels that are sideways
glowing glazes



[Low-Priority Bugs]
our TEs could do that crazy thermex optimization thing; some function that gets called before onUpdate. But we have to make sure that we aren't cheating anywhere. It's TileEntity.hasWorldObj(); no inherent issues with overriding, except what we make. So check them.
do block breaking animations properly (after 1.3). Look at src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src/RenderGlobal.java +1569 renderWorld()

[Features]
Redstone signal on furnace heaters
right-clicking a barrel with a tool could put stuff in as if you had right-clicked with an empty hand
Go over our API stuff. Clean up. Make sure other people can actually use stuff. (Maybe test this?)
Occasionally enable all warnings & clean things up

Need more uses for diamond shards!
  Shard spear? :o  Something about dark crystals. 

backup occasionally, eh?


SPACE
=====
FZDS Uses:
  Asteroids (Natural/Artificial Satelites, Planetoids, motherships)
  Space ships
  Megabosses
  Rotatable Frames? Robotics? Real Mecha Suits?


COSMOLOGY
---------
The world is an infinite plane. Other dimensions (nether, end, mystcraft ages) are not something you can walk to. The Farlands/End of the World don't actually exist, since that's just an artificial limitation of the computer game.
Light has no speed limit, but it does have a propagation limit. Light comes in several classes. A photon has these properties: Color, direction, travel distance, and class (sky illumination, torch/block illumination, reflection of illumination, and entity/FX-emitted). Steve's retinas can only perceieve reflected and emitted light, not illumination; they also can not detect photons that have travelled over a certain distance.
The world of Minecraft is an infinite plane suspend above over an infinite black hole. The black hole plane will crush anything that gets near it. It can bend light (causing void fog). If you fall into the void, your view will be squashed!
Inverium is what prevents the world from falling into the void. It can be found only underneath bedrock. Don't mine it; that would cause the world to fall into the void. Inverium is anti-void. You can try dropping it into the void, but it will float at around y=1
Inverium can also be found in the asteroids above. If you remove the inverium from them, they will (eventually, not immediately) fall to the ground. (But they will most likely burn up in the atmosphere?)
The inverium supporting the overworld has guardians. We wouldn't want the world to fall down, now would we?

  only allows in items with color/dye names. Sorts them automagically by color.
  proooobably won't be able to implement ISidedInventory decently. :(
  How will the server know what's colored?
    1. Create a list of all the colored dyes. Be sure to check the OreDictionary for dyes..
    2. Iterate over all the crafting recipes:
      If the recipe contains a single item from the list (and any additional items not on the list), add it to the list.
    3. Repeat step 2 until nothing else is added.
  each color gets 3 slots
  clicking on a slot will put it in the regular inventory.
  And... stuff added to the regular inventory'll try to be moved to their color slots.

  Okay. So items can be taken from the slots, but they can't be put in. They have to be inserted indirectly via the extra
  slots on the bottom.

Boats. Of course, you'll need a splash potion-like to set them afloat. This will, obviously, require the most annoying ingredients available:
    Ghast tear, ink sack, cyan dye, leather, feather...

Moderator:
  prevents you from using items based on their package? Probably voids them from your inventory as well.

Invasive charge'd be nice (lets you transmit charge through metal blocks)

When we get to doing sound:
  Overwrite TileEntityNoteBlock (& NoteBlock may be necessary as well)
  Shift-clicking tunes down
  Putting a white/gray/light gray/black wool block over the note dampens the sound (and continues searching upward for...)
  Blocks of metal.
  silver, stakced up:
    1 block gives a bell
    2 gives a weaker organ (or maybe a flute noise?)
    3 gives a stronger organ
    4 gives an awesome organ
    5 gives an epic organ
  gold: a cymbal; would make sense for wider platforms of gold to make different pitches or something?
  dark iron: a cool mournful saw noise
  water: sine wave
  lava: square wave
  iron: saw wave (cactus'd make sense, but isn't actually possible :p)
  lapis block: ocarina
  another note block (maybe? the actual noteblock might interfere): something synthesizy
  obsidian: something brittle?


Chaos orbs:
  toss one. They cause some sort of crazy semi-scripted event. The endermen sell them. "1 cup of Chaos, scooped from beyond the edge of all Shadow"
    array of Object[], +Integer = noteblock, -Integer = timed delay; spawn vexian mob stacks

History speaks of "World Holes" as terrifying patches of void that ripped away entire chunks of land. Nowdays, world holes have been mostly tamed for practical use.
