\title{The Packager}

The packager is only slightly more complicated than \link{stamper}{the stamper}.
When 9 or 4 items have been inserted into it, it tries to craft them.
First it will try to craft the items in a 3x3 grid,
and if there is no recipe,
it will try crafting them in a 2x2 grid.

Like the stamper, its inputs are the top and sides,
its output is the bottom,
and it will emit a redstone signal when crafting.

If an item can be crafted as both a 3x3 and a 2x2,
then an \link{shifter}{item shifter} can be used to
insert the appropriate number of items for it to use.
