We need an item. Hmm. [\#{item.factorization:tool/matrix_programmer}] and there's our item! We need a bit more text so that we can see how badly it messes with the line height. Also why is this text purple.


Here's another item: \#{item.factorization:servo/component.fz.instruction.entryControl}

And another one! \#{tile.clayHardenedStained.gray}

This one is a link. \link{index}{{item.factorization:tool/matrix_programmer}}
This one is a link. \link{index}{\#{item.factorization:tool/matrix_programmer}}
