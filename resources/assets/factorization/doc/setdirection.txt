\title{Set Direction\#{item.factorization:servo/component.fz.instruction.setdirection}}

When a servo hits this instruction,
it will attempt to go in the direction it is pointing.

If it can not actually go that way,
it will at the next opportunity.
(Unless it is later told to go in a different direction.)
