0.7.25
  Bugfixes

0.7.23
  Ported to 1.5.1
  Ceramics: Gotten far too much love
    Previously made ceramics are now broke, as was foretold some months ago
    Firing:
        (Not new: DRY a sculpture using wool, or by leaving it alone for a while. Make it WET with a bucket of water)
        A DRY sculpture can be BISQUED using a furnace heater.
        A BISQUED sculpture can be GLAZED.
        A GLAZED sculpture can be HIGHFIRED using a furnace heater. This takes much longer, you'll want to speed it up by wrapping it in multiple furnace heaters. Pieces that extend outside the 1m^3 have more surface area available for heaters.
    Sculpting Tool Changes:
        New mold tool; right click a fired piece w/ necessary materials in your inventory to get a wet copy of it
        Rotation is much nicer
        Selection tool is gone; it uses subblock selection
        Removal tool is gone; use your fist. If the sculpture is wet, it'll break only the lump you're hitting.  (Sneak-break to break the entire sculpture.)
        Rotation tool split into global rotation & local rotation
        Reset tool will remove rotation (like before), or with shift-click reset position & size
        The tools can now be stacked up to 4. Using a stacked tool may boost the effect.
    Clicking on a clay lump with a ball of clay will create a new clay lump with the same size & rotation, placed on the side that you clicked on. (Unless it'd go out of bounds)
    Wet sculptures can be crafted together to merge them into a single sculpture. (But there is a 32 claylump limit)
    Sculptures now have (mostly) proper collision boxes
    Glazing:
        Glaze buckets have 32 uses; right click on a BISQUED lump to apply it.
        Each glaze is made using one of the glaze bases.
        The first glaze base is the common base; there is a hierarchy of more advanced bases
        There is a special glaze base, the mimicry base. If you craft it with a block, the glaze will use the block's texture.
  I've saved the best for last, but be warned! If you have food or drink in your mouth, cover it with a sturdy napkin or handkerchief, as you may damage your computer; if you're standing in a subway car, sit down, or wait until you have reached your destination before continuing to read this, as you may faint; if you have high blood pressure, or your family has a history of heart disease, forgo reading the rest of this changelog entirely; if you need to remain stoic in the presence of friends or colleagues, continue only behind closed curtains and in the utmost of privacy: the block breaking particles are no longer derpy. Yes, you did read that right. The block breaking & digging particles are no longer derpy. The particles actually look, for most things, like the breaking block.

0.7.21
  Furnace heaters can be deactivated with a redstone signal

0.7.20
  Fixed some dupe bugs

0.7.19
  Added netherrack dust; made by grinding netherrack
  Crystallizing metals now requires a higher-tier acid
  Routers do less netspam
  /fzds got more powerful and flexible
  Added an "/f" command. (Originally short for "/fog", but it's got other things now.) Has a few commands for running things client-side:
    far, 0, normal, 1, short, 2, tiny, 3, micro, 4, microfog, +, -: Adjusts the fog
    pauserender: Stops rendering; opening your inventory will resume it
    now, date, time: shows the real-world time
    clear, cl: Clears the chatlog
    saycoords: Makes you say your coords in chat.
    saveoptions, savesettings, so, ss: Saves Minecraft's options; it seems to have trouble doing this


0.7.17
  Router takes only strong power now
  Fixed key binding issue

0.7.16
  Bugs.


0.7.15
  Insubstantial changes to the License.
  Solar Turbines are being replaced with Solar Boilers and Steam Turbines.
    - The solar boiler is setup the same way the old turbine was. Instead of sucking water up from the bottom, it can also be piped in using some other mod's fluid transport. The steam comes out of the top side.
    - Solar boilers can also be stacked on top of eachother. Steam will be sent to the topmost boiler, and water will be shared. Steam will be sent to a Steam Turbine if it's placed ontop of the Boiler.
    - Redstone signal on the boiler will prevent it from sucking up water; signal on the turbine will stop it
    - This system is compatible with Railcraft steam. (And railcraft has a much better texture.)
    - The old solar turbine is now deprecated: It can no longer be crafted, but they will still work. Craft it to get the motor back.
  Redistributed ore processing yields. The yields, starting from 1 ore, are:
    Grinder: 2x
    Mixer: 2x (No increase here)
    Slag furnace: 2.5x (The .5x gives a 50% chance for 1 extra reduced chunk)
    Crystallizer: 3x
  The charge meter does a global notify if the player is fake. (It works in deployers! Aim the deployer *above* the conductor block.)
  Grinders are now crafted upsidedown, instead of having two different unsatisfactory recipes.
  Fixed crystallizer recipe bug
  Sounds actually work again. Derp.


0.7.14
  Solar turbine recipe uses glass panes instead of glass blocks
  Solar turbine uses less water; this prevents a fully powered one from causing block updates every half second.
  Mixers & Crystallizers now render more efficiently
  Wrath furnace handles netherbrick slabs
  Upgrading barrels is broadcast to other players

0.7.13
  Barrel network spam bugfix

  Silver nodes are smaller
  Removed spam
  Changed the colors of semiprocessed ore for the better.

0.6.9 -- Polished
  Fixed a bunch of terrible, awful bugs
  Fixed some long standing bugs, notably:
    - Mecha armor is now actually usable (?)
    - Slag furnace is no longer obsidian

0.6.8
  Made mirrors less heretical
  Made mirror arrangement more heretical

0.6.7
  Improved the pocket crafting table's "c" action. Some examples of its behavior: If you have two stacks of A and B like this:
        [AB-]
        [---]
        [---]
  and press c, it'll become
        [ABA]
        [B-B]
        [ABA]
  and if you have a stack of 5 wood like so
        [---]
        [--W]
        [---]
  it'll change to
        [---]
        [W-W]
        [WWW]
  Exo-armor: (Formerly known as Mecha-armor)
    - Rewrote event system; it is now more flexible & useful (Localization is incomplete ATM)
    - Changed default exo-keys to be less intrusive
    - Added a "Wall Jump" mecha armor upgrade. Run at a wall, jump, and activate the upgrade. The effect stacks, of course.

0.6.6 -- Buffed!
  The grinder is 60% faster
  The angular saw now has infinite use, and works on stone & glass.
  Since neither Notch nor nobody check isAirBlock, the wrath now lamp lights up 3 blocks away from the floor. (But it will light up at least 1, so you may need to raise them off the floor if there are problems.) This should help with most forestry farms and the railcraft Tunnel Boring Machine.

0.6.5
  Crystallizer inverium recipes actually work now.
  fixed BoH bug

0.6.4
  Fixed barrel enlargement recipe
  crafting machines emit a redstone signal
  craftpacket maker now has a dedicated slot for paper, and can no longer store infinite paper. Other paper-based products can no longer be used to make packets.

0.6.2
  Processing silver ore will now give you both silver and iron ingots. Any dirty lead gravel and clean lead chunks will no longer be usable.
  The extra slots in the crystallizer are now useful: If you place extra stacks of the material in them, they will be crystallized together.
  There are now NEI recipe handlers for all ore processing equipment. Clicking on the progress arrow in the GUI will show you all the recipes for that machine.
  Grinding is faster.
  Added in-world notification system; it's not quite perfect.
  Fixed problem placing certain items related to forge update.
  The proper battery now shows up in NEI.
  Using forge 298
  Battery discharging recipe
  This file is now in the Factorization jar.

0.6.1
  Using forge 272

0.6.0
  Grinder recipe no longer uses dark iron.
  Excorsized demons in favor of Inverium.
  Rewrote the energy net. 3rd time's the charm?


0.5.6
  Initing earlier will hopefully prevent a different BC facade crash.

0.5.5
  Re-arranged the config.
  Added a config setting to disable TE rendering
  Added inverium with a temporary recipe. Inverium will be used in the crystallizer to obtain exotic materials
  Added an angular saw. It requires a battery in your inventory, and has silk touch for (vanilla) ores.
  Diamond, redstone, and lapis ores can now be ground up.
  Fixed the BC errors probably
  Fixed the GL errors


0.5.4
  Fixed recharging batteries

0.5.3
  Added another slab recipe
  Fixed barrel recipe
  Fixed barrel lighting
  Wrath forges will only burn what's directly adjacent to the flame, making them 433% cooler.
  Changed charge propagation. Long distances should work now.
  Blowing up a diamond block now gives you 18 diamond shards instead of 12

0.5.0 -- Electrically Charged!
  Ported to Minecraft 1.3!
  Due to concurrency & laziness issues, the client will dynamically pick an additional block ID if possible. The block will be used only for rendering. I don't anticipate it causing problems with other mods. If you've somehow managed to use up all 4096 or so other block IDs, the real Factorization block will be used instead; this would cause occasional rendering glitches when using the integrated server.
  The pocket crafting table & bag of holding now respond to key presses only if they are not otherwise handled. BWAH-HA-HA-HA-HA!
  The barrel renders blocks much nicer now.
  Wrath lamp recipe is now 4 dark iron & 2 silver.
  Removed sentry demons chunk-loaders due to lack of confidence in their correctness. And also laziness. Use ChickenBone's chunkloaders instead. They may return with a change in job description.
  Wrath Forges are now more expensive to operate.
  A few bug fixes for the Router GUI, and the auto-ejector.
  Slots.
  Nerfed wrathforge. It's no longer refuelable, and will last for 36 blocks
  Silver ore nodes are now evenly distributed in every 5 chunks
  Created a recipe for stone slabs

  More Electricity:
    The battery block is made using acid & lead. When crafted, it will be fully charged. They do not stack. Battery blocks keep their charge when broken. They are used to craft magnets, which are used in motors. A battery block can't charge another battery block.
    The Grinder is the first step of the ore processing chain. A second use for diamond shards!
    Also there is the Mixer, which is used for water-based recipes
    Crystallizer; its recipes require 1 material, and a fluid to suspend them in. The fluid is not used up. It needs to be heated to get started. It takes 20 minutes to complete a recipe.


0.4.0 -- Secretly Updated!
  Electricity:
    Solar turbines, reflective mirrors, heaters, wires, charge meters
    Solar turbines require a few reflective mirrors facing towards it on the same y-level, and a water source block underneath. 4 mirrors will produce enough electric charge to power a heater.
    The heater allows you to run vanilla furnaces & slag furnaces without fuel. Place a heater adjacent to a furnace to heat it. A properly heated furnace will cook faster than normal. You can put more than one heater touching a furnace for extra speed.
    The wires are called "Soldering Wire". Since it's very weak structurally, it must be supported by a block (or supported by a wire that is directly supported).
    A Charge Meter will tell you how much charge is at conductor, how many conductors are connected, and what the average charge on them is.

  Wrath Fire now treats other netherbrickblocks properly
  Using more ore dict.
  Added ejection router upgrade. You'll need to use the filter upgrade with it.

0.3.2 -- Upgraded!
  In brief: Mecha-upgrades, and Router upgrades.

  Doesn't work with the old ModLoader. Do not install ModLoader, install the recommended Forge version instead.
  The pistonless recipe for makers has been removed, 'cause it didn't make sense, 'cause the recipe for pistons doesn't make sense.
  Redstone ore, Tin, and Copper are now slaggable.
  Bound demons are now mostly harmless, and unbound demons more dangerous.
  Internal workings of barrels changed so that they should now work with Logistics Pipes, and should be more likely to work with other item-moving systems by default.
  Since I found like 4 silver veins right next eachother in my playtest world, silver is now guaranteed to not spawn in every 3rd chunk.
  Routers:
    might work sensibly with frames now
    now have an upgrade system! And the GUI has been re-made. I'm hoping that an GUI w/o upgrades will be easier to understand.
  Router upgrades:
    Machine Filter (This was in the previous version. You will have to craft an upgrade & reset it if you were using it.)
    Item Filter ([i]Diabolus in machina![/i] You get 9 slots.)
    Speed Boost (Will be faster at removing items from a mostly empty network, or for networks that are large/complex)
    Thoroughness (Will attempt to completely finish handling a machine before going to the next one.)
    Bandwidth (Will move up to 1 stack of items at a time)
  Did I mention that you can turn off a router by giving it a redstone signal? That's not actually a new thing.
  Additional fun router-related fact: Many buttons can be right-clicked.
  Mecha upgrades:
    buoyancy barrel: This makes you rise quickly through the water. I hope you haven't forgotten your water elevators!
    cobblestone drive: a cobblegen in your back-pocket. The cobble will quickly disappear.
    shoulder-mounted piston: This lets you push blocks.
    wool: pretty colors. Others might not see it in SMP?
    A very small taste of things to come; these are mere toys. Most upgrades'll require an energy source and/or very, very exotic materials.
  Now using the cooler texture for dark iron. It looks so much cooler now.
  Buildcraft API no longer used
