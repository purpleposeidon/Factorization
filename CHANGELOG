0.5.3
  Added another slab recipe
  Fixed barrel recipe
  Fixed barrel lighting
  Wrath forges will only burn what's directly adjacent to the flame, making them 433% cooler.
  Changed charge propagation. Long distances should work now.
  Blowing up a diamond block now gives you 18 diamond shards instead of 12

0.5.0 -- Electrically Charged!
  Ported to Minecraft 1.3!
  Due to concurrency & laziness issues, the client will dynamically pick an additional block ID if possible. The block will be used only for rendering. I don't anticipate it causing problems with other mods. If you've somehow managed to use up all 4096 or so other block IDs, the real Factorization block will be used instead; this would cause occasional rendering glitches when using the integrated server.
  The pocket crafting table & bag of holding now respond to key presses only if they are not otherwise handled. BWAH-HA-HA-HA-HA!
  The barrel renders blocks much nicer now.
  Wrath lamp recipe is now 4 dark iron & 2 silver.
  Removed sentry demons chunk-loaders due to lack of confidence in their correctness. And also laziness. Use ChickenBone's chunkloaders instead. They may return with a change in job description.
  Wrath Forges are now more expensive to operate.
  A few bug fixes for the Router GUI, and the auto-ejector.
  Slots.
  Nerfed wrathforge. It's no longer refuelable, and will last for 36 blocks
  Silver ore nodes are now evenly distributed in every 5 chunks
  Created a recipe for stone slabs

  More Electricity:
    The battery block is made using acid & lead. When crafted, it will be fully charged. They do not stack. Battery blocks keep their charge when broken. They are used to craft magnets, which are used in motors. A battery block can't charge another battery block.
    The Grinder is the first step of the ore processing chain. A second use for diamond shards!
    Also there is the Mixer, which is used for water-based recipes
    Crystallizer; its recipes require 1 material, and a fluid to suspend them in. The fluid is not used up. It needs to be heated to get started. It takes 20 minutes to complete a recipe.


0.4.0 -- Secretly Updated!
  Electricity:
    Solar turbines, reflective mirrors, heaters, wires, charge meters
    Solar turbines require a few reflective mirrors facing towards it on the same y-level, and a water source block underneath. 4 mirrors will produce enough electric charge to power a heater.
    The heater allows you to run vanilla furnaces & slag furnaces without fuel. Place a heater adjacent to a furnace to heat it. A properly heated furnace will cook faster than normal. You can put more than one heater touching a furnace for extra speed.
    The wires are called "Soldering Wire". Since it's very weak structurally, it must be supported by a block (or supported by a wire that is directly supported).
    A Charge Meter will tell you how much charge is at conductor, how many conductors are connected, and what the average charge on them is.

  Wrath Fire now treats other netherbrickblocks properly
  Using more ore dict.
  Added ejection router upgrade. You'll need to use the filter upgrade with it.

0.3.2 -- Upgraded!
  In brief: Mecha-upgrades, and Router upgrades.

  Doesn't work with the old ModLoader. Do not install ModLoader, install the recommended Forge version instead.
  The pistonless recipe for makers has been removed, 'cause it didn't make sense, 'cause the recipe for pistons doesn't make sense.
  Redstone ore, Tin, and Copper are now slaggable.
  Bound demons are now mostly harmless, and unbound demons more dangerous.
  Internal workings of barrels changed so that they should now work with Logistics Pipes, and should be more likely to work with other item-moving systems by default.
  Since I found like 4 silver veins right next eachother in my playtest world, silver is now guaranteed to not spawn in every 3rd chunk.
  Routers:
    might work sensibly with frames now
    now have an upgrade system! And the GUI has been re-made. I'm hoping that an GUI w/o upgrades will be easier to understand.
  Router upgrades:
    Machine Filter (This was in the previous version. You will have to craft an upgrade & reset it if you were using it.)
    Item Filter ([i]Diabolus in machina![/i] You get 9 slots.)
    Speed Boost (Will be faster at removing items from a mostly empty network, or for networks that are large/complex)
    Thoroughness (Will attempt to completely finish handling a machine before going to the next one.)
    Bandwidth (Will move up to 1 stack of items at a time)
  Did I mention that you can turn off a router by giving it a redstone signal? That's not actually a new thing.
  Additional fun router-related fact: Many buttons can be right-clicked.
  Mecha upgrades:
    buoyancy barrel: This makes you rise quickly through the water. I hope you haven't forgotten your water elevators!
    cobblestone drive: a cobblegen in your back-pocket. The cobble will quickly disappear.
    shoulder-mounted piston: This lets you push blocks.
    wool: pretty colors. Others might not see it in SMP?
    A very small taste of things to come; these are mere toys. Most upgrades'll require an energy source and/or very, very exotic materials.
  Now using the cooler texture for dark iron. It looks so much cooler now.
  Buildcraft API no longer used
