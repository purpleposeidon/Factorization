% Dedicated recipe viewer mods do a much much better job.
% The output of this is pretty ugly, and there's no way to search for items.
% However, if you would like your machine's custom recipes (not IRecipes!) to be included
% as a backup way of looking at recipes,
% then send factorization an IMC message "AddRecipeCategory"
% with "Recipe Category Name|path.to.the.ClassHoldingTheRecipes|public_static_field",
% eg FMLInterModComms.sendMessage("factorization",
%                                 "AddRecipeCategory",
%                                 "Lacerator|factorization.oreprocessing.TileEntityGrinder|recipes");
% It will use reflection to explore the contents of the field.
% The field can be either an Iterable or a Map.
%
% Custom IRecipes will be included naturally as part of the exploration of Workbench recipes.
