\title{Building}

Factorization makes a few extra vanilla building blocks available for crafting.

Firstly, the all-bark forms of certain woods are available.
Crafting four logs in a shapeless recipe will create them.

Non-vanilla logs may occasionally have all-bark recipes available.

Flat sandstone can be made out of 2 sandstone pillars.

Two stone slabs can be crafted together to make double half slabs,
and two double half-slabs can make flat stone.

Four dirt can be combined to make dry dirt, which grass will not spread to.

Middle clicking has been made more useful.
If you middle click on a block that is not on your hotbar,
your inventory will be searched for that block.

Additionally, if you middle click smooth stone,
and you have smooth stone in your inventory,
then it will pull that block up if you have
no cobblestone.
This also applies to similar blocks.
