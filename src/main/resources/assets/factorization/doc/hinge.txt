\title{The Hinge}

This hinge contraption may be your best invention yet!
It resembles an ordinary iron block when closed,
but a narrow bolt of dark iron allows the two heavy slabs to rotate up to 180°.

Blocks can be placed on one end of the hinge,
and then rotated by punching the attatched blocks.

Its heftiness allows you to build doors much grander than those rinky-dink wooden ones.

A redstone signal will lock the hinge.

Giving the hinge itself a good smack will make it close.

Comparators will measure how far open a hinge is.
