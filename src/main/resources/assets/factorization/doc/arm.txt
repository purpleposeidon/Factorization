\title{The Robotic Arm}

The robotic arm is a \link{socket}{Socket Tool} that
right clicks from the backing inventory.
It can click on blocks and entities.

If the item doesn't seem to do anything,
the arm will try clicking from various angles.
It will continue through each item in its
backing inventory until it is able to use
something.

If it is unable to put an item back into its inventory,
it will drop it on the ground.
