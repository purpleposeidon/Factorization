\title{Solar Mirrors}

\#{item.factorization:mirror}Mirrors concentrate rays of sunlight onto \link{gen/boiler}{Boilers}.

Many mirrors are needed, at least 20, to get useful amounts of steam,
however the amount of sunlight reflected by an individual mirror can be boosted
by placing blocks of silver or gold next to it.
This does have diminishing returns.

Mirrors can only target boilers that are at the same height,
but it is possible to stack boilers on top of one another,
and boilers below will feed their steam & water to boilers above.

The boiler can be no more than 8 blocks away.

Placing a \link{gen/whirligig}{Whirligig} on the boiler and a \link{gen/charge}{Charge Generator} above the whirligig
will generate charge.
