\title{The Lacerator}

The lacerator is a \link{socket}{Socket Tool} that
grinds and destroys anything that is placed in front of it.

It is built by placing a
\#{item.factorization:motor}
Motor
on a 
\#{factorization.factoryBlock.SOCKET_EMPTY}
Socket Block,
followed by a
\#{item.factorization:diamond_cutting_head}
Diamond Cutting Head.

It requires \link{charge}{charge} to power its motor,
and it must have a backing inventory to drop the items
it collects.

If a mob or player steps in front of the spinning blades,
they will get hurt.
Mobs killed in this way have a small chance to drop XP.

The lacerator will break blocks that are in front of it.
How long it takes to break the block depends on that block's hardness.

Many blocks will be broken down when mined by the lacerator.
For example, smoothstone becomes cobblestone,
and iron ore becomes dirty iron gravel.

The lacerator can not break barrels.
Instead, it will process the contents of the barrel.

Items dropped by killed entities and broken blocks will
be put into an internal buffer, which will be drained
into the backing inventory.
If the buffer can't be emptied, then the lacerator will
become clogged and will stop operating.

A redstone signal will disable the lacerator.
